Hi there, if you are interested in visualising data stream learning results, currently the best aapproach is to use CapyMOA
https://github.com/adaptive-machine-learning/CapyMOA

Particularly, the tutorials for CapyMOA include examples on how to visualize Classification, Regression, Prediction Intervals and more!

# data-stream-visualization
A simple python script to plot results overtime for a data stream marking drifts (both abrupt and gradual). 

The `plotline(...)` was created to generate the plots for the MOA tutorial 'Simulating Concept in MOA'. 
There are two examples on how to use it in the drift_stream_plot.py file. 

The MOA tutorial can be found in here: 
https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/tutorial-5-simulating-concept-drift-in-moa/

## Dependencies
To successfully run this script you will need python 2 (it might fail on python 3). 
Also, you need matplotlib to generate the plots.
