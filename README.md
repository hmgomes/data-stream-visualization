# data-stream-visualization
A simple python script to plot results overtime for a data stream marking drifts (both abrupt and gradual). 

The `plotline(...)` was created to generate the plots for the MOA tutorial 'Simulating Concept in MOA'. 
There are two examples on how to use it in the drift_stream_plot.py file. 

The MOA tutorial can be found in here:

## Dependencies
To successfully run this script you will need python 2 (it might fail on python 3). 
Also, you need matplotlib to generate the plots.
